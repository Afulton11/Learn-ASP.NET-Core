===	
I am using Command-Query separation to talk with a custom database. This architecture is described incredibly well in [This Article On Commands](https://blogs.cuttingedge.it/steven/posts/2011/meanwhile-on-the-command-side-of-my-architecture/) and [This Article On Queries](https://blogs.cuttingedge.it/steven/posts/2011/meanwhile-on-the-query-side-of-my-architecture/). Both of articles are written by Steven van Deursen on his blog.
